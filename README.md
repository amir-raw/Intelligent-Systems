Projects Overview


project 1:Search
implemention of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


project 2: Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. implemention of  multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.


project 3: Reinforcement Learning
implemention of  model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.


project 4: Ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. implemention of  exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.


project 5: Classification
implemention of standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits.  Extended this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.
